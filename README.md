# Laravel Testing Project

Tutorial series that I followed to make this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuDger5Ytbc&list=PLdXLsjL7A9k0esh2qNCtUMsGPLUWdLjHp

This project was scaffolded with Laravel Breeze to set up auth routes with UI. The tests in Feature/Auth are also from Breeze. Tests are most done with PHPUnit, but a PEST example is also included.

To run this project, create .env and .env.testing files and copy/paste all vars from .env.example into both files. Then configure your database variables for dev db and test db.
